## 5. RECOMMENDED ARCHITECTURE CHANGES

### 5.1 Unified Investor Dashboard
**Problem:** Multiple dashboard components with overlapping functionality  
**Solution:**
```typescript
// New structure
src/pages/investor/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ InvestorDashboard.tsx (main entry)
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Portfolio.tsx (investments overview)
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ProjectDetails.tsx (single project view)
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Opportunities.tsx (available investments)
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Documents.tsx (document center)
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Payments.tsx (payment tracking)
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Reports.tsx (monthly reports)
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Settings.tsx (preferences)
```

### 5.2 Custom Hooks for Data Fetching
**Problem:** No data fetching logic  
**Solution:**
```typescript
// New hooks needed
src/hooks/investor/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ useInvestorPortfolio.ts
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ useProjectDetails.ts
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ useOpportunities.ts
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ useInvestorDocuments.ts
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ useInvestorPayments.ts
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ useMonthlyReports.ts
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ useInvestorPreferences.ts
```

### 5.3 Real-Time Subscriptions
**Problem:** No real-time updates  
**Solution:**
```typescript
// Implement Supabase subscriptions
useEffect(() => {
  const channel = supabase
    .channel('investor-updates')
    .on('postgres_changes', {
      event: '*',
      schema: 'public',
      table: 'projects',
      filter: `id=in.(${investorProjectIds.join(',')})`
    }, handleProjectUpdate)
    .subscribe()
  
  return () => supabase.removeChannel(channel)
}, [investorProjectIds])
```
